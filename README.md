👋 Hey there! I'm Monika Gupta, a coding wizard 🧙‍♂️ by day and a pixel perfectionist by night 🌙. When I'm not busy squashing bugs 🐛 or pushing pixels 🎨, you can find me dreaming up ways to automate my coffee machine ☕ using Python (the snake, not the comedy group).

🔧 **Skills:**  
- Fluent in CSS HTML and sarcasm 🗣️
- Adept at turning caffeine into code ☕ ➡️ 💻
- Can design a UI that even my mom can use (true story!) 🎨

💡 **Fun Facts:**  
- My code runs on coffee. Without it, my commits tend to get a bit... buggy 🐞.
- I once tried to use CSS to fix my bedhead. It didn't work, but now my hair has some impressive transitions 🌪️.
- I've debugged more spaghetti code than an Italian chef 🍝.

👾 **Current Projects:**  
- Creating a wireframe for a mental health app 💭:
I'm sketching out the blueprint for an app that's like a personal therapist in your pocket (minus the couch and the hefty fees). 
- Building a dashboard using Python 📊:
Picture this: a dashboard so sleek and insightful, it makes even your most chaotic data look like it’s ready for a magazine cover. 

📫 **How to reach me:**  
- Carrier pigeon preferred, but email works too ✉️.

🌟 **Motto:**  
"Code like it's your last compile, design like nobody's pushing pixels, and always remember: in case of fire, git commit, git push, leave building."
